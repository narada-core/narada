## Project Overview

Narada is a composed topology of authority-homogeneous zones connected by governed crossings.

- A **zone** is a region in which one authority grammar remains invariant.
- A **governed crossing** is the durable, admissible transfer from one zone to another.
- A crossing is not separate from its regime: each crossing edge carries its own admissibility regime, crossing artifact, and confirmation law.
- Narada preserves correctness by preventing illicit shortcuts across zones and by requiring every meaningful crossing to produce a durable artifact under an explicit regime.

Viewed operationally, Narada is a generalized, deterministic kernel for turning remote source deltas into locally materialized state and durable side-effect intents. It tolerates crashes at any point, handles re-fetching overlapping data, and converges to correct state without coordination with the source.

**Primary Shape**: Narada is not best understood as a bag of modules or only as a pipeline. Its primary explanatory shape is:

- a composed topology of authority-homogeneous zones,
- connected by governed crossings.

From that primary shape, the familiar Narada readings follow:

- **state compiler**: what the topology does;
- **nine-layer pipeline**: one canonical traversal through the topology;
- **Aim / Site / Cycle / Act / Trace**: operator/runtime view of the same topology;
- **Intelligence-Authority Separation**: one core invariant of the topology;
- **crossing regime**: the local law governing each crossing.

**Core Identity**: This is NOT a sync client, cache, or mirror. It is a deterministic state compiler from remote deltas into local canonical state, with a durable control plane for action governance. That compiler reading is derived from the deeper zone-and-crossing structure above.

**Mailbox as One Vertical**: The Microsoft Graph/Exchange mailbox integration is the first vertical built on the kernel. It uses:

- `ExchangeSource` as one `Source` implementation
- `mail.*` fact types as one fact family
- Mailbox policy/charters as one policy family
- `mail.*` intents as one intent/executor family

**Peer Verticals**: `TimerSource`, `WebhookSource`, `FilesystemSource`, `InboxDropSource`, and `process.run` are first-class peers that travel through the same kernel pipeline (Source → Fact → Policy → Intent → Execution → Observation).

**Fact Boundary**: Facts are the first canonical durable boundary. All replay determinism derives from fact identity. No kernel section may assume mailbox, conversation, or message semantics.

**Intent Boundary**: `Intent` is the universal durable effect boundary. All side effects (mail sends, process spawns, future automations) must be represented as an Intent before execution. Idempotency is enforced at `idempotency_key`.

**Terminology**: See [`TERMINOLOGY.md`](TERMINOLOGY.md) for the user-facing vocabulary guide, and [`SEMANTICS.md`](SEMANTICS.md) for the complete system ontology. In short: users set up and run **operations**; Narada compiles each **operation** into exactly one internal **scope**.

## Technology Stack and Runtime

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Language | TypeScript 5.3+ |
| Runtime | Node.js 22+ (ES modules, `"type": "module"`) |
| Package manager | pnpm 8+ workspace monorepo |
| Module system | ESM (`NodeNext` module resolution) |
| Compiler | `tsc` (authoritative); `oxbuild` available as a faster non-authoritative probe |
| Test runner | Vitest 1.x |
| Property testing | `fast-check` (control-plane) |
| Mock filesystem | `memfs` |
| Schema validation | Zod |
| Persistent state | SQLite via `node:sqlite` (Node.js built-in) |
| FTS search | SQLite FTS5 (`packages/verticals/search`) |
| CLI framework | `commander` + `@clack/prompts` + `chalk` |
| Versioning / release | Changesets CLI (`@changesets/cli`) |
| TypeScript loader for scripts | `tsx` |

All packages declare `"type": "module"` and compile to `./dist/` with declaration maps. The authoritative build is `tsc`; `oxbuild` is only a probe and must not be treated as the canonical compiler.

---

## Monorepo Layout

The workspace is declared in [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](pnpm-workspace.yaml). It includes:

- `packages/*`
- `packages/layers/*`
- `packages/verticals/*`
- `packages/domains/*`
- `packages/sites/*`

### Grouping Convention

Packages are grouped when they fit one canonical slice:

- `packages/layers/*` — kernel, CLI, and daemon layers
- `packages/domains/*` — charter, policy, and domain models
- `packages/verticals/*` — vertical implementations (e.g., mailbox, search)
- `packages/sites/*` — per-substrate Site materialization templates

Cross-cutting runtime, contract, MCP, carrier, NARS, agent, operator, and UI packages live flat under `packages/*` because they span multiple layers or substrates. Each package's `description` and `.narada/capabilities/package-role-catalog.json` entry are the authoritative sources of its responsibility and authority role.
- External sibling repositories (when present):
  - `../narada-core/packages/*`
  - `../mcp-surfaces/packages/*`
  - `../agent-cli`
  - `../agent-tui`

| `@narada-core/agent-web-ui` | `packages/agent-web-ui` | Production per-session browser UI for one NARS session |

The workspace landing page (`/`) and console HTTP server live in `@narada-core/cli` (`packages/layers/cli/src/commands/operator-workspace-page.ts`, `console-server.ts`, `console-server-routes.ts`, `console-register.ts`).

Archived packages live under `packages/_archive/`. Contract, carrier, MCP, NARS, agent, operator, and UI packages live flat under `packages/*`. Treat each as a focused package with its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `vitest.config.ts` where present; use its `description` and role-catalog entry to determine responsibility and authority.

### `.ai/` tracking boundary (deliberate)

Under `.ai/`, **durable coordination artifacts are tracked in git; machine
state is ignored**. Tracked: `do-not-open/tasks/` (task files are working
documents — agents edit them and lifecycle gates read them), `decisions/`,
`chapters/`, `handoffs/`, `observations/`, `mutation-evidence/`,
`task-contracts/`, `inbox-envelopes/`, `learning/`, `law/`, `continuations/`.
Ignored (`.gitignore`): `task-lifecycle.db*`, `inbox.db*`, `state/`, `tmp/`,
`runtime/`, `metrics/`, `mcp/`, `publications/`, `agents/roster.json`,
`operator-surface-send-queue/`. When a new `.ai/` artifact class appears,
decide which side it belongs to; if it is machine state, add it to
`.gitignore` in the same change that introduces it.

---

## Build, Typecheck, and Verification

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Fast verification (default)

```bash
pnpm verify
```

Runs:
1. Task file guard (`scripts/task-file-guard.ts`)
2. CLI output admission guard (`scripts/cli-output-admission-guard.mjs`)
3. Typecheck (`pnpm typecheck`)
4. Build (`pnpm build`)
5. Task lifecycle snapshot guard (`pnpm narada:guard-task-db`)
6. Task-governance smoke tests
7. Charters tests
8. Ops-kit tests

This is the reliable ~15-second default after local changes.

### Build and typecheck

```bash
pnpm build            # tsc across all packages
pnpm typecheck        # tsc --noEmit across all packages
```

Control-plane build also regenerates `config.schema.json`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @narada-core/control-plane generate:config-schema
```

### Multi-repo workspace state (accepted fragility, guarded)

The pnpm workspace deliberately spans sibling repos (`../narada-core`,
`../mcp-surfaces`, `../agent-cli`, `../agent-tui`), so builds, typechecks, and
tests consume those checkouts' **live, possibly uncommitted** state. An
uncommitted sibling change can break narada's build mid-session (this happened
on 2026-07-18 via narada-core `TaskSpecRecord.tags`).

`pnpm build` and `pnpm typecheck` run `scripts/sibling-workspace-state-guard.mjs`
first (`prebuild`/`pretypecheck`), which lists every sibling repo's dirty files
so the source of a failure is visible instead of silent. Modes via
`NARADA_SIBLING_GUARD`: `warn` (default), `strict` (fail when dirty, for
CI/release), `off`. Decision record:
`.ai/decisions/20260719-2067-agent-context-session-start-convergence.md`.

### Fabric tool-list drift check (site hygiene)

Site fabric tool declarations go stale as MCP servers evolve. After changing
a surface's tools, the registrar catalog, or when a surface seems to be
missing tools, run per site:

```
mcp_loader_site_tool_inventory_check({ site_root: <root>, surface_ids: ["<surface>"] })
```

Verdicts: `ok` | `drift` (declared ≠ exposed; includes `probe_failed` when
the child won't even start, and `surface_not_declared` when the fabric
resolution finds nothing — check `<site>/.ai/tmp/mcp-payloads/workspace/site-tools-*`
for the full findings). Repair: `registrar_site_bind({ site_id, surface_id })`
rewrites the fabric from the catalog; verify the catalog first with
`registrar_compare_surface_tools`. Watch for: retired `config.json` stubs
shadowing aggregate fabrics (loader resolution prefers `config.json`), and
old-generation fabric files (`<site>-agent-context-mcp.json` vs
`narada-<site>-agent-context-mcp.json`) causing duplicate-surface or
site_id-mismatch errors. Full-fabric checks (all surfaces) can exceed the
MCP transport budget — run per-surface.

Env delivery has two independent channels and both must be right: fabric
`env_vars` inject variables into **carrier** processes at launch, while the
loader's `allowedEnvVars` policy governs **probe children** (inventory/drift
checks). A surface can pass loader checks while broken for carriers (missing
fabric `env_vars`) or vice versa — diagnose against the channel that is
actually failing. Registrar rebinds can silently drop fabric `env_vars` when
the catalog lacks them; re-check after catalog edits (fixed in mcp-surfaces
b8b0dcb; feedback sfb_6889eb33-243).

Coverage note: the 2026-07-19 sweep (#2143) inventoried only the
agent-context surface across all registered sites; other surfaces remain
unchecked. When a surface's tools change, run the same per-surface check for
it across every registered site root, not just the site you are working in.

### Testing

Root `pnpm test` is intentionally disabled. Use the escalation ladder:

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `pnpm verify` | Fast guard + typecheck + build + fast tests | **Default** |
| `pnpm test:focused "<cmd>"` | Run one focused command with telemetry | Single file or small bounded run |
| `pnpm test:unit` | Unit tests across all packages | Heavy suites included |
| `pnpm test:integration` | Integration tests only | Durable-state or I/O changes |
| `pnpm test:control-plane` | Control-plane tests only | Control-plane internals |
| `pnpm test:daemon` | Daemon tests only | Daemon or integration surface |
| `ALLOW_FULL_TESTS=1 pnpm test:full` | Full recursive suite | CI, release prep, explicit request |

Focused test examples:

```bash
# Single control-plane test file
pnpm test:focused "pnpm --filter @narada-core/control-plane exec vitest run test/unit/ids/event-id.test.ts"

# Single CLI test file
pnpm --dir packages/layers/cli exec vitest run test/commands/task-report.test.ts

# Launcher verification: typecheck first, then one focused launcher test
pnpm --filter @narada-core/cli test:launcher:focused -- test/commands/workspace-launch-admission.test.ts

# Inbox tests (integration-heavy; keep bounded)
pnpm --dir packages/layers/cli exec vitest run test/commands/inbox.test.ts test/commands/inbox-mutation-evidence.test.ts
```

`pnpm test:focused` records timing and classification to `.ai/metrics/test-runtimes.json`.

For launcher work, direct Vitest invocation is behavioral exploration only. Use
`pnpm --filter @narada-core/cli test:launcher:focused -- <one-test-file>` when the
result must count as verification; this command runs CLI typecheck first and
does not start the behavioral test if compilation fails. The broad
`test:launcher` command remains the launcher suite and includes the workspace
launch admission tests.

### Known test teardown noise

The project uses `node:sqlite`, the Node.js built-in SQLite binding. Unlike the previous `better-sqlite3` dependency, `node:sqlite` does not rely on a native add-on whose destructors can race V8 garbage collection. An exit code 133 / SIGTRAP after tests complete should therefore be treated as `infrastructure-failure` and investigated, not dismissed as harmless teardown noise.

### Lint

```bash
pnpm control-plane-lint   # Enforces vertical-neutrality in kernel modules
```

This script (`scripts/control-plane-lint.ts`) scans `packages/layers/control-plane/src/{scheduler,facts,intent,sources,executors,charter,foreman,coordinator,observability}/` and fails if mailbox-specific terms (`conversation_id`, `thread_id`, `mailbox_id`, mailbox-era table names, or mail-vertical imports) leak into generic kernel modules. CI runs this.

**Note**: Some CI workflow files reference `pnpm lint` and `pnpm fmt --check`. These scripts are not defined in the current root `package.json`. Use `pnpm control-plane-lint` for the active invariant lint. The formatter configuration lives at `packages/layers/control-plane/.oxfmtrc.jsonc` (oxfmt style). Use `pnpm toolchain:oxbuild-probe` to probe the alternate oxbuild toolchain.

---

## Code Style and Conventions

### TypeScript posture

- All packages use `strict: true`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`.
- ESM only. Import paths include `.js` extensions for compiled outputs; source uses TypeScript paths.
- Prefer explicit return types on public package exports.
- Dependency injection via constructor/options objects.

### Naming grammar

| Pattern | Example | Use For |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `lower_snake_case` | `source_adapter`, `foreman_decision` | Code identifiers, config keys, fact predicates |
| `kebab-case` | `crossing-regime`, `task-attachment` | File names, CLI commands, URL paths |
| `PascalCase` | `CrossingRegime`, `TaskAssignment` | TypeScript types, interfaces, classes |
| `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `CROSSING_REGIME_INVENTORY` | Constants, enums, environment variables |
| `lower.kind:id` | `mail:thread_abc123` | Subject identifiers in facts |

Past tense for predicates (`order_created`, not `create_order`). Specific verbs (`shipped`, `confirmed`, not `updated`). Stable once deployed.

Names identify; they do not mean. String names may be used as stable identifiers for exact lookup, routing to explicitly declared objects, correlation, logging, and display. They must not be parsed to infer authority, capability, effect, domain, policy, type, or behavior. Put those semantics in explicit schema/config/registry metadata. See [`docs/concepts/names-identify-do-not-mean.md`](docs/concepts/names-identify-do-not-mean.md).

### Formatter configuration

`packages/layers/control-plane/.oxfmtrc.jsonc`:

- printWidth: 100
- tabWidth: 2, spaces
- singleQuote: true
- trailingComma: `all`
- endOfLine: `lf`

Other packages follow the same style by convention; no root formatter config is present.

### Module boundaries

- `packages/layers/control-plane/src/types/` is a leaf module.
- Generic control-plane modules must use `context_id` / `scope_id`, never `conversation_id` / `mailbox_id`.
- Mail-specific logic belongs in `adapter/graph/`, `normalize/`, `projector/`, `persistence/messages`, `foreman/mailbox/`, `coordinator/mailbox-*`, or `observability/mailbox.ts`.
- New verticals build against `context_id` / `scope_id` and `outbound_handoffs`.

---

## Testing Strategy

- **Focused first**: Prefer `pnpm test:focused` with a single test file. Do not run the full suite unless explicitly requested.
- **Suggestion surface**: Before deciding verification manually, run `narada verify suggest --files <changed-files>`.
- **Fixtures prove boundaries**: A fixture must show that useful behavior passes through the claimed structure without bypassing authority boundaries.
- **Coverage thresholds** (control-plane): lines 70%, functions 70%, branches 60%, statements 70%. CLI thresholds: lines 60%, functions 60%, branches 50%, statements 60%.
- **Telemetry**: `scripts/test-telemetry.ts` records run classification (`success`, `assertion-failure`, `infrastructure-failure`, `known-teardown-noise`).
- **Test databases**: `packages/layers/control-plane/test/db-lifecycle.ts` provides `createTestDb()` and `closeAllTestDatabases()`. Many existing tests still use raw `new Database(":memory:")`; new/refactored tests should prefer the helper.

---

## Deployment and Release

### Versioning

Uses Changesets:

```bash
pnpm changeset              # Add a changeset
pnpm version-packages       # Bump versions and generate changelog
```

### Release

```bash
pnpm release                # Runs scripts/publish-local.ts
```

The release script:
1. Verifies a clean git worktree.
2. Verifies npm authentication.
3. Runs `pnpm prepublish-check`.
4. Runs `pnpm version-packages`.
5. Rebuilds (`pnpm build`).
6. Runs `pnpm pack:check`.
7. Publishes with `changeset publish`.

### CI/CD

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — typecheck, tests, coverage, control-plane lint on push/PR.
- `.github/workflows/test-cross-platform.yml` — Node 18/20/22 on Ubuntu, Windows, macOS; Windows-specific and path tests.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — build, full tests, and Changesets release on `main`.
- `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` — benchmark runs.

### CLI shim installation

```bash
pnpm narada:install-shim    # bash scripts/install-narada-shim.sh
```

Installs the `narada` CLI shim so the binary is available on PATH.

## Security and Secret Handling

### Secret resolution precedence

1. Environment variables (highest)
2. Secure storage references (`{ "$secure": "key" }`)
3. Config file values (lowest)

### Graph API credentials

| Source | Env Var | Config Key |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Access token | `GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `graph.access_token` (via secure ref) |
| Tenant ID | `GRAPH_TENANT_ID` | `graph.tenant_id` |
| Client ID | `GRAPH_CLIENT_ID` | `graph.client_id` |
| Client Secret | `GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET` | `graph.client_secret` |

### Charter runtime API key

| Source | Env Var | Config Key |
|--------|---------|------------|
| OpenAI API key | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `charter.api_key` |

### Secure storage

`SecureStorage` implementations: `KeychainStorage`, `FileSecureStorage`, `InMemorySecureStorage`. If `{ "$secure": "key" }` references exist and no storage is provided, config loading throws before side effects.

### Operational security rules

- Do not commit secrets, credentials, tokens, private mailbox contents, or private operational data to the repo.
- Use `sanitizeForLogging` and related helpers in `packages/layers/control-plane/src/logging/sanitize.js` before logging.
- Email-originated operator requests may only create pending audited `operator_action_requests`; no `From:` header or message body may directly approve an action.
- The operator console mutates only through `executeOperatorAction()` with a safelisted action set.

---

## Task and Agent Execution Contract

This is a summary. The full contract is in [`.ai/task-contracts/agent-task-execution.md`](.ai/task-contracts/agent-task-execution.md).

- **Artifact discipline**: Update the original task file; do not create derivative status files (`-EXECUTED.md`, `-DONE.md`, `-RESULT.md`, `-FINAL.md`, `-SUPERSEDED.md`).
- **Task numbers**: Never allocate by filename sorting. Use `scripts/task-reserve.ts` or scan `# Task NNN` headings in `.ai/do-not-open/tasks/*.md`.
- **Target locus before mutation**: Identify the target Site/locus/path before mutating task, inbox, roster, lifecycle, or publication state. `/home/andrey/src/narada` defaults to read-only doctrine inspection unless Narada proper is explicitly named as the mutation target.
- **Task-store routing**: Every site has its own task-lifecycle store and MCP binding; there is no cross-store list view. Tasks about a site's internals go in that site's store; cross-site or meta work (sweeps, registry hygiene, release decisions) goes in the andrey-user store. When looking for existing work, check the store of the site it concerns.
- **Completion**: Submit a WorkResultReport with `narada task report` or `narada task finish`. Chat "done" is not lifecycle authority.
- **Closure invariants**: A task may close only when all acceptance criteria are checked, execution notes exist, verification notes exist, and no derivative status files exist.
- **Authority boundaries**: Do not bypass `ForemanFacade`, `Scheduler`, `IntentHandoff`, `OutboundHandoff`, outbound workers, or observation/control separation.

---

## Critical Invariants (Must Never Violate)

### Inbound / compiler

1. **No Loss After Commit**: `cursor = c` ⇒ all events ≤ c have been applied.
2. **Replay Safety**: `apply(e)` multiple times ⇒ same final state.
3. **Determinism**: `normalize(remote_data)` produces identical output for identical input.
4. **Idempotency Boundary**: Enforced at `event_id` → `apply_log`.
5. **Apply Ordering**: `apply(e)` → `mark_applied(e)` → `cursor_commit` (never reorder).

### Control plane

6. **Foreman owns work opening**: Only `DefaultForemanFacade.onSyncCompleted()` / `onFactsAdmitted()` may insert `work_item` rows. Both delegate to a private `onContextsAdmitted()`.
7. **Foreman owns evaluation resolution**: Only `DefaultForemanFacade.resolveWorkItem()` may transition a `work_item` to `resolved`.
8. **Foreman owns failure classification**: Only `DefaultForemanFacade.failWorkItem()` may transition a `work_item` to `failed_retryable` or `failed_terminal`.
9. **Scheduler owns leases and mechanical lifecycle**: Only `SqliteScheduler` may insert/release `work_item_leases` and transition items to `leased` or `executing`.
10. **IntentHandoff owns intent creation**: Only `IntentHandoff.admitIntentFromDecision()` may create `intent` rows.
11. **OutboundHandoff owns command creation**: All `outbound_commands` + `outbound_versions` must be created inside `OutboundHandoff.createCommandFromDecision()`.
12. **Outbound workers own mutation**: Only outbound workers may call the source adapter to create drafts / send messages / move items.
13. **Charter runtime is read-only sandbox**: It may only read the `CharterInvocationEnvelope` and produce a `CharterOutputEnvelope`.
14. **Decision Before Command**: `foreman_decision` is append-only; one decision produces at most one command.
15. **No automatic replay on startup**: Replay, preview, recovery, rebuild, and confirm operators require explicit trigger.

### Observation / UI

16. **Observation is read-only projection**: `layers/control-plane/src/observability/` derives data exclusively from durable stores.
17. **Control surface separated**: Operator actions mount under `/control/scopes/:scope_id/actions`. The observation namespace (`/scopes/...`) is GET-only.
18. **UI cannot become hidden authority**: The operator console mutates only through audited `executeOperatorAction()`.
19. **No mailbox leakage into generic observation**: `conversation_id` and `mailbox_id` must not appear in generic observability types/queries.

### Outbound

20. **Draft-First Delivery**: Agents and workers never send directly; they create a draft first.
21. **Two-Stage Completion**: A command reaches `submitted` when Graph accepts it, and `confirmed` only after inbound reconciliation observes the result.
22. **Worker Exclusivity**: Only the outbound worker may create or mutate managed drafts.

### Crossing regime

23. **No crossing without regime**: Every zone-to-zone boundary crossing that produces a durable artifact must have an explicit crossing regime.
24. **Authority changes at boundaries**: If a transition does not change authority owner, it is an internal state transition, not a boundary crossing.
25. **Regimes are not transitive shortcuts**: `Source → Fact → Context → Work` is valid; `Source → Work` is an authority collapse.

### Advisory signals

26. **Advisory signals are non-authoritative**: Removing every advisory signal must leave all durable boundaries intact.
27. **Advisory signals are overrideable**: Consumers must have a sensible fallback when a signal is absent, contradictory, or stale.
28. **Advisory signals have no lifecycle side effect**: Emitting or consuming one must not transition the lifecycle state of a durable object.

## Review Checklist for Future Architecture Changes

When proposing changes that touch public types, docs, or package surfaces, verify:

- [ ] **Kernel-first framing**: Docs and comments describe the generalized behavior first, vertical specifics second.
- [ ] **No mailbox-default types**: Generic interfaces use `scope_id` / `context_id`, not `mailbox_id` / `conversation_id`.
- [ ] **Vertical parity**: New features for one vertical have a plausible path for peers (timer, webhook, filesystem, process).
- [ ] **Authority boundaries preserved**: No new write paths bypass `ForemanFacade`, `Scheduler`, `IntentHandoff`, or `OutboundHandoff`.
- [ ] **Observation remains read-only**: No UI-facing code mutates durable state directly.
- [ ] **Control-plane lint passes**: `pnpm control-plane-lint` reports zero violations.
- [ ] **Fixture discipline defined**: Before implementing a component that crosses an integration boundary, define the fixture shape that will prove the boundary works.
