# Narada Documentation

Root documentation organized by semantic layer.

## `concepts/`

## Onboarding Scope Map

These terms describe different crossings and are not interchangeable:

- **Personal User Site onboarding**: the first-time Windows path for starting one `resident` General assistant without creating project infrastructure. Start with [`first-time-operator-success-path.md`](product/first-time-operator-success-path.md#user-first-windows-onboarding-ux).
- **Operation bootstrap**: declaring and preparing governed work in an ops repo. Start with [`bootstrap-contract.md`](product/bootstrap-contract.md).
- **Site bootstrap**: creating an explicit runtime Site boundary for a project, client, PC, or other earned locus. Start with [`site-bootstrap-contract.md`](product/site-bootstrap-contract.md).
- **Cascading onboarding**: recording progressively stronger Site capability and readiness layers. See [`cascading-onboarding.md`](product/cascading-onboarding.md).
- **Inhabited onboarding**: proving that a bootstrapped Site can carry representative operations through its boundaries. See [`inhabited-onboarding.md`](product/inhabited-onboarding.md).

## `deployment/`

Site materialization and deployment target docs.

- [`cloudflare-site-materialization.md`](deployment/cloudflare-site-materialization.md) — Cloudflare Site materialization design
- [`site-ui-and-wrangler.md`](deployment/site-ui-and-wrangler.md) — shared UI ownership, math rendering, and Wrangler release contract for public sites
- [`systemd/`](deployment/systemd/) — systemd unit files and service configuration

## `testing/`

Focused verification contracts for bounded implementation slices.

- [`operator-console-route-directory.md`](testing/operator-console-route-directory.md) — Route-directory failure, recovery, projection, and CLI verification matrix

## `diagrams/`

System diagrams and interaction diagrams.

*(Empty — diagrams are inline within concept and product docs.)*
