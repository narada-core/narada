# First-Time Operator Success Path

This is the canonical path for a first-time Operator to move from fresh materialization to usable Narada work without documentation spelunking.

The path is deliberately explicit about authority-affecting crossings. Each crossing has a command family that should own the mutation or observation. The User Site onboarding path and the operation-specific path each have one front door; neither front door hides the crossings.

## Choose the Path

If you are a first-time Operator who wants a personal assistant, go directly to [User-First Onboarding UX](#user-first-onboarding-ux). Its front door is the User Site resident-first path; you do not need to create an ops repo, Project Site, PC Site, or remote Site first. Use the substrate-specific installation runbook only for host setup and supervision details.

If you already have a User Site and want to declare or run governed work, use the [Full Operation Path](#full-operation-path). The operation path is intentionally more detailed because it covers intake, Site selection, role binding, work selection, and effect proof.

The related terms have distinct scopes: **Personal User Site onboarding** starts one general assistant; **operation bootstrap** declares governed work; **Site bootstrap** creates an explicit runtime boundary; **cascading onboarding** records readiness layers; and **inhabited onboarding** proves representative operation through a Site.

## Substrate Evidence Boundary

Narada is not a Windows-only product. Its core CLI, documentation, task governance, inbox, and Site concepts are intended to remain portable across supported substrates.

The intensively exercised first-time Operator substrate today is narrower: Windows 11 with WSL, Windows Terminal, PowerShell launcher scripts, local Git, Node tooling, and Windows User/PC Site coordination. The Operator Surface inhabitation path involving stable window labels, focused input, runtime binding, PC-locus messaging, and multi-agent ergonomics has the strongest evidence on that stack. macOS and Linux paths may run core flows, but they do not yet have equivalent evidence for spatial Operator Surface inhabitation.

First-time Operator guidance should therefore point new Operators to the Windows 11 path first when they want the currently proven inhabited-agent experience, while avoiding any claim that Narada itself is Windows-only.

## Success Definition

There are two valid success targets, and the simpler personal target is the default.

### Personal User Site success

A first-time user succeeds when they can:

1. start one healthy User Site `resident` assistant;
2. see successful identity hydration;
3. submit one human operator request;
4. receive a useful or explicit no-work response; and
5. read durable readiness evidence without inspecting raw runtime state.

### Operation success

An Operator taking the operation-specific path succeeds when they can:

1. declare the work Aim as an Operation Specification;
2. materialize or select the Site/runtime locus that will host the work;
3. instantiate a role identity and receive bounded bootstrap text;
4. bind or route the Operator Surface without pretending the surface grants authority;
5. admit first intake through Canonical Inbox or a declared source;
6. ask `work-next` for the next governed action;
7. run one representative loop through readiness proof and trace;
8. see residual blockers and next commands without reading raw SQLite, task files, or full lifecycle snapshots.

## Full Operation Path

This is the complete operation-specific path after the Operator has a User Site and wants to declare or run a particular operation. It is not the default first-time User Site path described below.

| Step | Operator intent | Governed crossing | Command family | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Declare what Narada should do | Operator pressure -> Operation Specification | `narada init`, `narada want-mailbox`, `narada want-workflow` | operation config, preflight result |
| 2 | Choose where it runs | Operation Specification -> Site/runtime locus | `narada sites init`, `narada sites bootstrap-*`, `narada sites doctor` | Site config, Site doctor result |
| 3 | Prove substrate can host work | Site realization -> readiness posture | `narada doctor --bootstrap`, `narada sites doctor`, `narada preflight` | bounded readiness report |
| 4 | Start an AI role | Operator request -> role identity contract | `narada operator-surface agent instantiate`, `narada sites agent-bootstrap` | role identity record, bootstrap text |
| 5 | Bind the surface if possible | role identity -> Operator Surface / runtime binding | `narada operator-surface bind-focused --as self` | binding record or runtime-locus deferral |
| 6 | Admit first input | outside message/file/report -> Canonical Inbox or source facts | `narada inbox submit`, `narada inbox ingest-files`, source-specific sync | inbox envelope or fact admission |
| 7 | Select next work | Site posture -> next governed action | `narada work-next`, `narada task work-next`, `narada inbox work-next` | selected action packet or no-work reason |
| 8 | Execute representative loop | action intent -> Act / Trace | `narada task claim`, `narada test-run`, `narada command-run`, operation commands | reports, verification runs, command runs |
| 9 | Publish readiness | trace -> readiness proof | `narada sites doctor`, `narada task evidence`, `narada publication`, docs artifact | readiness state and residuals |

## Boundary Distinctions

| Boundary | Must not collapse into |
| --- | --- |
| Operation Specification | Site folder, runtime, mailbox, chat request |
| Site/runtime locus | current shell, clone, CLI binary, Operator Surface |
| Role identity | model session, terminal title, task authority |
| Operator Surface binding | effect capability, review authority, Operator consent |
| Inbox intake | task creation, command execution, truth admission |
| Work-next | autonomous assignment loop, hidden recommendation |
| Readiness proof | green build alone, docs alone, chat confidence |

## Failure Posture

Failures must return bounded repair commands instead of pushing the Operator toward raw state inspection.

| Failure | Bounded posture | Preferred command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing dependencies or stale CLI dist | Report bootstrap readiness, shim source, dist freshness, package build posture, and repair plan. Stale dist warns by default and only blocks governance commands under explicit strict mode. | `narada doctor --bootstrap --format json`; strict: `narada doctor --bootstrap --strict --format json` |
| Missing native SQLite binding | Report delegated CLI/native binding health | `narada inbox doctor --format json` or `narada doctor --bootstrap --format json` |
| Stale clone or embodiment mismatch | Name authority locus and clone posture | `narada task preflight --format json`, `narada inbox doctor --format json` |
| Absent Operator Surface transport | Return runtime-locus deferral, not guessed handles | `narada operator-surface bind-focused --as self` |
| No admitted work | Return no-work reason with blockers | `narada task workboard --format json`, `narada work-next --format json` |
| Deferred dependency | Require explicit unblock evidence | `narada task unblock <n> --agent <id> --evidence <text> --rationale <text>` |

## Operation-Specific Front Door

For an already selected Site and Operation, the operation-specific front door is:

```bash
narada operator start --site <site-id-or-root> --operation <operation-id> --format json
```

The command is the orchestrated guide over the crossings above. It is read-only by default and must not become a hidden authority shortcut. Its output is bounded:

- current Site and Operation coordinates;
- missing prerequisite checks;
- exact next command;
- bootstrap text or Operator Surface handoff when appropriate;
- readiness proof or residual blockers.

Focused verification:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/layers/cli exec vitest run test/commands/operator.test.ts --pool=forks --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1 --minWorkers=1 --testTimeout=120000 --hookTimeout=120000
```

Observed result for the onboarding proof: the fixture walks from an absent Site to a configured Site with missing role binding, then to a fully idle Site with a bound architect identity. It asserts bounded JSON fields, explicit blockers, precise unblock commands, governance coordinates, and final next-work guidance.

## User-First Onboarding UX

Status: target UX contract with the CLI first slice and User Site browser onboarding composition implemented. The CLI detects the host platform by default; Windows PowerShell and native Linux are substrate-specific execution paths over the same User Site onboarding contract. The resident-first provisioning boundary, deterministic defaults, demo fallback, and NARS-backed first-use status projection exist; approved roles are materialized into the launch registry through the explicit `narada onboarding roles materialize` crossing. A clean User Site does not fabricate principal admission or launch context: the resident launch is reported as an explicit setup block until intelligence readiness is complete.

Human CLI output keeps the launch payload structured while projecting a bounded handoff: the saved result path, launch/session identifiers, health and event endpoints, and the browser projection URL when one is available. A `blocked` onboarding start returns a nonzero process exit code, so shell automation cannot mistake an unresolved intelligence prerequisite for a successful launch.

The default path is User Site first. A first-time user should become productive without creating a Project Site, naming a PC Site, registering a remote Site, or understanding the full Site topology.

### Platform-Neutral CLI Front Door

The CLI infers `windows` or `linux` from the host when `--platform` is omitted. The ordinary first-use commands are therefore:

```text
narada onboarding start --scope user-site --interactive
narada onboarding status --scope user-site
```

Use `--platform windows` or `--platform linux` only when an explicit override is required for a controlled test or a cross-host administrative workflow. The User Site onboarding root is distinct from an explicitly named Site: on Linux it defaults to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/narada/user`, while `narada sites init <site-id> --substrate linux-user` uses `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/narada/<site-id>`.

### Windows Install Boundary

The supported first-time Windows install boundary is the self-contained release artifact from `https://narada.systems/install.ps1`. A source checkout is a contributor path and is not required for ordinary User Site use.

Prerequisite: Node.js 22 or newer.

```powershell
irm https://narada.systems/install.ps1 | iex
narada install windows-user-site --profile minimal
narada doctor --bootstrap
```

`minimal` is the ordinary-user profile: it provisions the User Site, one `resident` assistant, and the default operator
surface path. `advanced` is an explicit capability profile for Operators who need Cloudflare, additional roles, MCP
development, or Site administration:

```powershell
narada install windows-user-site --profile advanced
```

The profile is recorded in the User Site installation manifest alongside the CLI, runtime-server, and Web UI package
versions. It does not create roles, publish a Site, or enable unattended execution by itself.

The install command provisions the User Site launch registry, the package-owned PowerShell launcher, and the provider-secret helpers under `%USERPROFILE%\Narada`. `narada doctor --bootstrap` is the bounded readiness check; when repair is needed it returns the single repair command:

```powershell
narada install windows-user-site --repair
```

Provider setup is an explicit branch, not an implicit install side effect:

| Path | Credential posture | Next command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Demo | No credentials; synthetic data | `narada onboarding start --platform windows --scope user-site --demo` |
| Codex subscription | Local Codex authentication | `codex login`, then `narada doctor --bootstrap` |
| API provider | User Site SecretManagement/SecretStore entry | `Pwsh -File "$env:USERPROFILE\Narada\tools\operator-secrets\Set-NaradaProviderSecret.ps1" -Provider <provider> -InstallModules` |

API provider readiness can be inspected without printing secrets:

```powershell
Pwsh -File "$env:USERPROFILE\Narada\tools\operator-secrets\Test-NaradaProviderSecrets.ps1"
narada doctor --bootstrap
```

The doctor emits provider-specific readiness rows in JSON. `demo` is always ready; `codex-subscription` checks only the
local Codex auth home; API providers use the managed SecretStore status helper when available and otherwise report
`check_required` with the provider-specific setup command. The doctor does not make a live provider request and never
copies secret values into the report.

The first-use page must preserve these branches and must not imply that a source checkout, a Site-specific MCP file, or an API key is required for the credential-free demo.

### Windows Front Door

Once the CLI is available, the canonical command is:

```powershell
narada onboarding start --platform windows --scope user-site --interactive
```

For a browser-guided local path, start the CLI-owned Operator Console and open
the First Use page at `/console/onboarding`:

```powershell
narada console serve
```

Open the URL printed by the command, then choose **First Use**. The page is a
projection of `narada doctor --bootstrap` and `narada onboarding`; it does not
create a second onboarding authority or handle provider secrets in the browser.
It keeps the advanced Site/runtime launcher available, but the first-use path
asks only for confirmation to start the personal `resident` assistant or to
try the credential-free demo. If the User Site lacks explicit intelligence
launch context, principal binding, or provider readiness, it explains the
setup block and does not start the runtime or operator surface.

The one-time PowerShell bootstrapper may install or locate the CLI and create or locate the User Site, then hand off to this command. It must not own onboarding policy, runtime selection, MCP assembly, provider logic, or terminal orchestration.

The installed Windows handoff is equivalent:

```powershell
Pwsh -File "$env:USERPROFILE\Narada\Start-NaradaWorkspace.ps1" -Onboarding
```

`-Onboarding` is the thin bootstrap path. Explicit Site, role, operator-surface, and runtime selection remains on the advanced workspace launcher path. Intelligence provider and model resolution are owned by the admitted Site intelligence catalog, not by launcher arguments. On source checkouts, the installed `Start-NaradaWorkspace.Dev.ps1` (next to the plain shim in the User Site) is the development launcher: it drives the CLI from the checkout with dist-freshness and operator-surface projection checks.

When the onboarding launch selects the browser surface, the launcher passes an explicit User Site onboarding mode into
Agent Web UI. The browser then shows a compact first-use panel with the resolved workspace, `resident` General assistant,
intelligence, Browser surface, and Resident runtime authority. Before the first request it offers human-facing starter
intents; while a turn is active it shows that the assistant is working; after the first response it explains that resident
is sufficient and offers a prefilled question about optional architect and builder roles. Technical details remain collapsed
and the role prompt remains an operator decision rather than a roster mutation.

The first screen should ask only:

1. `Where do you want to work?` — when only the User Site exists, preselect `Personal workspace` and do not present a Site decision. If other Sites are already known, expose `Choose another workspace` as a secondary action.
2. `Start your assistant?` — primary action: `Start my assistant`. Show `General assistant` with technical role id `resident` as secondary detail.

The screen should show the resolved defaults in a non-interactive summary:

```text
Workspace: Personal workspace
Assistant: General assistant
Surface: Browser (terminal fallback)
Intelligence: Registry default (resolved provider)
Local setup: Ready
```

Runtime host, operator surface, provider, MCP scope, and local execution details are available under `Advanced launch options`; they are not first-time decisions. Every displayed combination must come from the admitted capability matrix.

### Default Resolution

Default resolution is deterministic and visible:

- use the User Site resident identity;
- use the managed local execution host without asking the user to create a named PC Site;
- prefer the best available operator surface, with browser projection first when available and terminal fallback otherwise;
- prefer an already authenticated subscription or configured provider;
- offer demo/no-provider mode when the user has not yet declared live work;
- ask for one provider choice only when no usable default exists.

The local execution host is machine-local infrastructure. It may have a durable PC-locus binding, but that binding is not presented as a required Site choice and never becomes User Site authority. Provider secrets remain in User Site SecretManagement/SecretStore state and never enter Site config, launch artifacts, logs, or chat.

### First Useful Session

The first onboarding mutation creates exactly one `resident` identity for the selected User Site. The UI uses the human label `General assistant`; `resident` is secondary technical detail. Runtime launch remains gated by explicit intelligence setup and is not implied by creation of the launch record.

The onboarding proof is complete only when the user sees:

1. a healthy session;
2. identity hydration succeeded;
3. the input is ready;
4. one operator message was admitted;
5. one useful response or explicit no-work response; and
6. durable readiness or checkpoint evidence.

The first prompt should be human-facing, such as `What would you like to work on?`, not `startup_sequence {}` or an MCP tool name. Technical startup events remain available in diagnostics.

After the Operator sends the first request, the bounded readiness readback is:

```powershell
narada onboarding status --scope user-site
```

The status command correlates the resident launch session binding with the Site-local NARS session index, probes `/health`, and reads a bounded tail of the session `events.jsonl` projection. It reports healthy session, identity hydration evidence (a successful startup tool result on tool-driven operator surfaces, or the session start plus ready lifecycle transition on the narada-agent-runtime-server surface), input readiness, an operator-sourced admitted input (`input_admitted_to_turn` or the runtime's `input_event_started`), and a useful or explicit no-work response. It writes only non-secret readiness evidence to `.narada/runtime/onboarding/user-site-onboarding.json`; it never copies provider output or credentials into that artifact. A legacy state without an exact launch/session binding remains pending until the operator supplies `--session`.

### Contextual Role Expansion

After the first useful interaction, the CLI first slice may recommend role expansion when the current roster has no suitable
planning or implementation role. The recommendation is gated by verified first use and is always an explicit operator choice.
The CLI does not infer a Site policy or silently interpret the user's request as authorization; a surface that has those
additional evidence sources may add them before presenting the same affordance.

The recommendation is a single durable affordance, not a recurring chat interruption:

> You are working in a resident-only workspace. Add planning and implementation roles?

The primary actions are `Add recommended roles`, `Keep resident only`, and `Not now`. The UI may show `Planning (architect)` and `Implementation (builder)` as outcome-first labels. Adding roles always requires explicit Operator confirmation and produces a preview of the roster changes. `Not now` is remembered and suppresses repetition until the user asks for role expansion.

The current CLI approval boundary is explicit and non-destructive:

```powershell
narada onboarding roles approve --scope user-site --confirm
```

It records the Operator's approval and a role preview in the User Site onboarding state, but does not silently mutate the launch registry or start additional roles. Materialization is the follow-up governed crossing:

```powershell
narada onboarding roles materialize --scope user-site
```

It consumes the recorded approval and writes the approved roles into the User Site launch registry as quiet `agent-cli` background entries. Roles are deliberately not prominent: the resident assistant remains the single browser front door, materialized roles never start automatically, and launching them stays an explicit advanced-launcher action. Task-roster and identity instantiation remain their own crossings.

The progression, in the vocabulary the onboarding state machine actually persists (`narada.user_site_onboarding_state.v1`), is:

```text
not_started
  -> blocked                      (resident launch awaits explicit intelligence setup)
  -> launch_requested             (onboarding start launches the resident after setup; demo_available marks the demo path)
  -> first_use_verified           (first useful interaction verified; blocked if verification fails)
  -> role_expansion: available    (contextual architect/builder recommendation)
  -> role_expansion: approved     (roles approve --confirm; recorded, nothing launched)
  -> role_expansion: materialized (roles materialize; quiet registry entries)
```

Every step past `first_use_verified` is optional and requires explicit Operator action.

Agent naming conventions: personae such as Kevin, Bob, Robin, and Stuart are callsigns mapped onto the role taxonomy (architect, builder, operator, resident), not roles of their own; the launch-registry `Role` field is optional. The canonical agent-id form is `<site-prefix>.<name>` (for example `andrey-user.resident`); sonar's bare names (`architect`, `builder`, `resident`, `operator` with `Site = "sonar"`) are a legacy exception, not a pattern to copy. The mcp-surfaces records intentionally use `WorkspaceRoot = <src-root>` because those agents manage MCP surfaces across repositories. The retired v1 roster projection (`.ai/agents/roster.json`, pre-rename `narada-andrey.*` ids) is superseded by the launch registry; the task-roster crossing remains deferred.

### Deferred Expansion

After first-use verification, the user can explicitly expand into:

- a Project Site when work becomes repository-specific;
- a named PC Site when machine-local administration needs a user-visible boundary;
- a remote or Cloudflare Site when authority must move across machines; or
- a scheduled Site when unattended cycles are required.

Each expansion is a separate, explained crossing. None is required for the User Site resident path.

This UX is a projection over the existing launcher and runtime contracts, not a second launcher implementation. The advanced path exposes explicit Site, role, operator-surface, and runtime choices; the Site intelligence catalog remains authoritative for provider, model, route, endpoint, credential, and thinking-level resolution.

## Verification Rule

Verification for this path uses sanctioned read surfaces only:

```bash
narada doctor --bootstrap --format json
narada task preflight --format json
narada sites doctor <site-id-or-root> --format json
narada operator-surface labels build --site <site-id-or-root> --format json
narada operator-surface inspect compact --site <site-id-or-root> --format json
narada task workboard --format json
```

Do not verify first-time Operator readiness by opening `.ai/task-lifecycle.db`, directly reading task projection files, or inspecting full lifecycle snapshots.
