# Cloudflare Operator Projection

This private workspace package owns the shared Cloudflare-origin projection
Worker and its Durable Object NARS authority runtime. The Worker exposes NARS
session routes together with the remote Operator Console and Host Fleet
projection routes. The package name describes the shared projection boundary;
it does not transfer NARS or Host Fleet authority to the Operator Console or
to Cloudflare. Its package exports point at compiled `dist/` output; the
repository ignores `dist/`, so consumer lifecycle gates build the projection
package before consuming it:

- @narada-core/agent-web-ui builds it before build, test, test:unit, and typecheck.
- @narada-core/cli builds it before build, test, and typecheck.

The same rule applies to a clean checkout: run the following before invoking a
consumer entry point directly:

    pnpm --filter @narada-core/cloudflare-operator-projection build

## Cloudflare-native runtime

The provider-capable lane uses the shared
`@narada-core/invokable-intelligence-runtime` Cloudflare gateway. D1 owns the
catalog and plan; the Worker supplies `INTELLIGENCE_REGISTRY_DB`, optional `AI`,
outbound fetch, and named secret bindings referenced by catalog credential
locators. The Durable Object owns the NARS session, ordered event journal,
replay, health, input serialization, abort, and revocation. Local filesystem,
shell, local MCP, and local artifact authority are not available in this lane.

Production sessions require `principal_id` and verify `site_id`,
`user_site_id`, and `host_site_id` against D1 before provider dispatch.

## Operator Console epistemic graph

The Site graph page and API are ordinary admitted Operator Console routes:
`/console/sites/<site-id>/epistemic-graph` and its `/api` child. The Worker
does not host a second graph ledger or trust identity fields from the browser.
After Cloudflare Access verification it checks the gateway route directory,
then proxies the request through the configured origin-pinned bridge or VPC
service. The local Console resolves the registered Site and invokes that
Site's admitted `epistemic-graph` MCP surface under its server-owned operator
principal. Thus local and Cloudflare projections share one Site authority and
one optimistic-concurrency ledger contract.

## Verification

If an older deployment is public because it predates the fail-closed Access
gate, lock it down before provisioning Access. This mode sets only
`OPERATOR_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REQUIRED=true` and refreshes the bridge secret; it
does not invent an issuer, audience, or Access application:

    pnpm --filter @narada-core/cloudflare-operator-projection build:scripts
    node packages/cloudflare-operator-projection/scripts-dist/operator-console-mirror-deploy.js --lockdown

Planning mode is safe and does not contact a deployment:

    pnpm --filter @narada-core/cloudflare-operator-projection smoke:provider-capable-live

The synthetic authority smoke and the provider-capable smoke target different
deployments. Deploy the synthetic worker with the configuration that omits D1
and AI bindings:

    pnpm --filter @narada-core/cloudflare-operator-projection deploy:synthetic

Run the synthetic smoke against that worker, including the browser credential
required by the deployment:

    pnpm --filter @narada-core/cloudflare-operator-projection smoke:cloudflare-origin-live -- --live --cloudflare-api-base-url https://<synthetic-operator-projection-worker> --browser-token fingerprint:<operator-browser>

The deployed provider-capable smoke requires an HTTPS Worker URL, an explicit
principal, and the browser credential. It creates and revokes one session, so
it must be run only against an operator-approved production deployment:

    pnpm --filter @narada-core/cloudflare-operator-projection smoke:provider-capable-live -- --live --cloudflare-api-base-url https://<operator-projection-worker> --principal-id principal:<operator> --browser-token fingerprint:<operator-browser>

## Host Fleet live E2E

The Host Fleet live runner proves the machine boundary rather than only the
in-process Worker emulator. It stages a unique temporary publisher config,
membership secret, and current standalone publisher bundle on the publisher
host over SSH, invokes that bundle, polls the deployed Worker read model for a
fresh heartbeat, and removes the remote staging directory in all outcomes.
The remote checkout therefore does not need a current Narada CLI or workspace
installation. The secret value, SSH output, and publisher output are excluded
from evidence.

Run it from the authority host with an operator-approved deployment, the
authority's existing membership secret, and the active credential key ID from
the authority configuration. The key ID must match exactly; it is part of the
signed admission contract:

    pnpm --filter @narada-core/cloudflare-operator-projection smoke:host-fleet-cloudflare-live -- --live --cloudflare-api-base-url https://<operator-projection-worker> --membership-secret-file <authority-membership-secret> --key-id <authority-active-key-id> --ssh-target <publisher-user>@<publisher-host> --ssh-key <publisher-private-key> --remote-node-path <publisher-node>

The runner builds and uploads a current standalone publisher bundle for each
run, then executes it with the staged config. Use a dedicated test host or an
explicit temporary deployment roster entry; the runner never changes the
persistent Host Fleet config or SQLite state. The deployed Worker gateway and
the local authority gateway/tunnel must be healthy before the run; otherwise
the runner records the typed refusal and does not claim an end-to-end pass.
